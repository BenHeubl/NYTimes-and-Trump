# NYTimes' Coverage of Trump

My project looks at how the NYTimes' Coverage of Trump has changed since he has announced his candidacy. I gathered approximately 2,200 news articles from the NYTimes focusing on Donald Trump and used topic modeling to map how the topics of the articles have evolved over the past year. Future work may include doing sentiment analysis to see how the tone of the coverage has changed or including non-news articles (e.g. Op-Eds, Editorials).
